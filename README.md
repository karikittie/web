# web

Welcome to the front End of the World0 Project. 

Currently, we are in the setting up tools and depencency place. Ultamatly, the goal is to use https://react.semantic-ui.com 
to build a clean elegent modern interface. Eventually, the site will get charicter, but the goal is to get it working first :D

If you are intrested in helping, Instillaton of tools and documentation on how they work is the number one priority. Alternatly, 
if you are an HTML/JavaScript/React expeert and want to help prepare the front end for the client/server front-end/back-end
communication, or a CSS expert who wants to make it pretty, that is also welcome :D
